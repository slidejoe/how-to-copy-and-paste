<!-- ## CFP

Since the dawn of Forums, CodeProject and Stack Overflow - and more recently with Our Umbraco, Github, Discord, Youtube and blog posts - we've been building applications with strangers on the internet, copying and pasting other developers' code. And now with the advent of ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot and other AI solutions, it's easier than ever to use code somebody (or something) else wrote... without necessarily understanding the code completely. We all copy and paste code, but a senior developer will often approach the task in different way to someone more junior. We'll look at how to level-up our Ctrl+V game through understanding the problem, assessing suitability and adapting code samples to meet our needs. Together, we can build something better and quicker... so long as we know what we're building. -->

<!--
We've all heard that software developers are just "professional Googlers" - the more senior you are is mostly a product of how good you are at Googling.

It's a great joke... but have you tried being a developer _without_ internet access? It doesn't feel like much of a joke then, does it?

But I don't see this as a negative. When we're isolated we might feel weak and hopeless but as a team - a community - we're quick and efficient problem solvers. And that's where the idea for this talk came from: how can we work together more effectively as a worldwide developer community without getting stung along the way?

This photo is from after a Umbraco festival in the UK, when me and Paul (from Codeshare, creater of the Clean Starter Kit) went back to our hotel.
The aim was to grab a snack and get some sleep, but we accidentally ended up fixing some bugs in the Clean Starter Kit together!

In an open source world, we're much stronger together.

So we shouldn't be afraid to ask for help, and to offer our expertise to others.

## Where to get help

<!-- Before we start with how and what to copy and paste, let's first start with some places we might find answers -  -->

### Google it first!

* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-books"></i>Documentation
* <i class="fa-fw fab fa-youtube"></i>YouTube
  **CodeSharePaul**, talk recordings, etc
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-blog"></i>Blog posts
  Personal blog, **Skrift**, etc
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-code"></i>Source code
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-question-square"></i>Existing answers to other people's questions

### So you need to ask for help?
If you can't find the answer you're looking for, it's time to ask for help.

## *How* to ask for help

How can we ask for help in a way that's most likely to get the best possible answer?

<!--
How can we ask for help in a way that's most likely to get the best possible answer?

Although the community is very helpful, it't to our own benefit to ask the right questions in the right places.
-->

* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-search"></i>Do your research *first*
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-head-side-brain"></i>Comprehend the problem
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-hands-heart"></i>Be polite and patient - nobody _has_ to help you

<!-- 

Do your research *first* 
Although you've already searched for an answer to your question, it's also important we do some background research so we can explain ourselves correctly and be very specific about our problem.

Comprehend the problem
There's very little point in asking a question if we don't know what we're asking. If we don't understand what we're asking we need to ask a different question

Be polite and patient - nobody _has_ to help you

On-topic and suitable (including tags, categories, etc)

Summarize your problem

Include a reproducible example

We know this is good advice, because it's from StackOverflow. And if anybody is fussy about how you ask a question, it's them! -->

### What to ask where
Some questions lend themselves to specific environments.

* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-comments-alt"></i>Vague or conceptual question, hand holding
  * > How might I go about implementing a...?
  * Suited to a chat format, like Discord
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-poll"></i>Opinionated or niche question
  * > Which is more performant...?
  * Get a quorum by asking on social media
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-align-left"></i>Technical or specific question
  * > I'm trying to do this by ... but I'm getting an error...
  * A forum might be better suited, Our Umbraco or StackOverflow

<!--

Discord - one person can ask questions to help work out what you need
Social media - lots of people can chime in with their opinions and experiences
Forum - tend to be longer questions with longer answers
-->

On topic & suitable: Umbraco Discord, help-with-umbraco channel, hoping for a quick, short reply (it actually helped us chat it over and try things out without me needing to replicate)
Summarize your problem: Pictures! "I would like to..."
Reproducible example: Provided Umbraco version, media picker version, exact setup - I could do this!

## Improvable question

This is someone's first StackOverflow question - it's not necessarily a **bad** question, but we could improve it.

## What about **AI**?

AI is an other place we can ask questions for help.

* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-people-carry"></i>Effectively **built by the community**

### When might I want to ask elsewhere?

* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-tachometer-alt-slowest"></i>Poor understanding of performance
* <i class="fa-fw fad fa-sparkles"></i>Understanding versions
  - Old Umbraco vs Umbraco 9+

Makes things up: AI will rarely tell you that you can't do something. It will generally make up ways you can... even if those ways are not possible and use API methods that simply don't exist.

So, you've asked a question and got an answer. Now we need to know...
## How to Copy & Paste

## Copy & Pasting vs. Comprehending

* Computer or robot, we need to **understand** what we're copying into our projects.
* Big indicator of seniority
* We don't need to understand every intricacy of the code, but we should have an idea line-by-line what it's doing

## Assess Suitability of Code

## Comprehending & suitability

* Does it answer my question?
* Line by line, what is this doing?
* Does the code match the description?
* Does that _feel_ right?
* How can we increase our confidence in this answer?

![bg right fit Screenshot of a ChatGPT interaction. The prompt reads "Write me some C# code to decide whether to output black or white text dependent on a hexadecimal background color" and the answer includes a code sample with the explanation "This code first parses the hexadecimal color string into its red, green, and blue components. It then calculates the luminance of the color using the standard formula for converting RGB values to luminance. Finally, it uses the luminance value to decide whether to output black or white text."](images/chatgpt-luminance.png)


<!--
Does it answer my question?
Read Q and A

Line by line, what is this doing?
- takes a hex string value
- splits out R/G/B values
- converts them from hex to int
- calculates a "luminance"
- checks for luminance value (128 = 256/2)

Does the code match the description?
The code seems to match up with the description

Does that _feel_ right?
- things I don't fully understand
- generally somewhat like I was expecting
- I didn't know the hex conversion function existed, but it seems right

How can we increase our confidence in this answer?

Most useful info: I now know I want to calculate the luminance.
So now I can go away and validate the luminance formula (which it got right!) and we're away!
I can also check luminance is

```
hexColor = "#ffffff"

r = "ff" = 256
g = "ff" = 256
b = "ff" = 256

luminance ≈ (0.2 * 265) + (0.7 * 256) + (0.1 * 256)
          ≈      53     +     180     +      26
          ≈ 261

261 > 128

result = "#000000"
```


```
hexColor = "#1b264f"

r = "1b" = 27
g = "26" = 38
b = "4F" = 79

luminance ≈ (0.2 * 27) + (0.7 * 38) + (0.1 * 79)
          ≈      5    +     27    +      8
          ≈ 40

40 < 128

result = "#FFFFFF"

## Adapting Code to Meet Needs

When we understand the code, we can tweak it to our needs

We'd all have a better idea of how to modify the previous example to, for example:

* Enforce accessibility contrast levels
* Change the resulting colours (not black/white)
* Extract this method into smaller reusable helper methods
